meta_prompt = """Developer: You receive a script as input. Generate a single JSON object containing video thumbnail information, a catchy title, an SEO description, and keywords, using the structure defined below. All output must be plain textâ€”do not use markdown, special formatting, or additional syntax in any field.

Instructions:
- 'videoTitle': Write an attention-grabbing title that subverts expectations or popular beliefs, related but not identical to the thumbnail text.
- 'image': Create a detailed, click-maximizing prompt for an SFW thumbnail image. The image must not depict harm.
- 'text': Compose a very brief, enticing, easy-to-read phrase for thumbnail overlay, directly linked to the script and image. Use pronouns to reference the image subject, avoid complex grammar, keep it broad, and spark curiosity without giving away the video's content.
- 'description': Write an informative, compelling, SEO-optimized description (150-160 characters), including relevant keywords.
- 'keywords': Provide 5-8 relevant search terms as a comma-separated string, no spaces after commas.
- Output fields must be ordered: videoTitle, image, text, description, keywords.

Output Format:
Only return the JSON object below:
{{
  "videoTitle": "string",
  "image": "string",
  "text": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "keywords": "string"
}}

If the script is missing or empty, return all fields as null.

    Forget what you think you know aboutsamurai. We often romanticize them asnoble, honorable masters of the blade.But the true path to becoming one wasnot just rigorous. It was a soulccrushing, mindbending, brutally extremegauntlet designed to break all but themost unyielding. This wasn't merelyabout learning how to wield a katana. Itwas about stripping away fear, pain, andindividuality. transforming a humanbeing into an emotionless weapon in aterrifying crucible of discipline anddeath. From their earliest childhood,every breath was a step deeper into thisrelentless ordeal.So, what truly happened when a younghopeful dared to walk the path of thesamurai? Prepare to discover theunimaginable trials that forgedhistory's most legendary warriors.[Music]Before we delve into the sheer brutalityof samurai initiation, it's crucial tounderstand why such extremity was notonly accepted but demanded. The samuraiwere not merely warriors. They formedthe elite ruling class of feudal Japan.Their very existence predicated onunwavering loyalty, marshall prowess,and an unshakable readiness to die fortheir lord. This wasn't a job. It was asacred calling where the fate of entiredomains often rested on their blades.Such an immense burden necessitated anequally immense commitment to training,forging not just skilled fighters, butparagonss of discipline and honor. Thisfoundational philosophy codified asbushido or the way of the warrior wentfar beyond physical combat. Itencompassed an entire code of ethicsdemanding absolute loyalty, courage inthe face of death, unwaveringself-control, and a stoic acceptance ofone's fate. It was this profoundsocietal role and the tenets of Bushidothat provided the bedrock for theintensity of their training,transforming mere individuals intoliving weapons imbued with anunbreakable spirit.It wasn't a journey they embarked uponas adults. The crucible of samuraitraining began almost from the momentthey could walk. From the tenderest age,these children were subjected to anintense psychological conditioningmeticulously crafted to forge unshakablediscipline and an iron will. Everylesson, every game, every interactionwas a deliberate step towards instillingunwavering obedience, an uncannytolerance for pain, and perhaps mostcrucially, the absolute suppression offear. They learned not to flinch, not tocry out, and certainly not to retreat.their young minds being systematicallyrewired to view discomfort as a lessonand danger as merely another challengeto be overcome long before they everheld a real katana.Beyond the initial grueling years, thepivotal moment for a young samuraiarrived with the genpuku, the coming ofage ceremony. While often romanticallysimplified to a mere haircut and thebestowyl of a new adult name for thesenent warriors, this was far from aquaint ritual. This wasn't just aboutexchanging a boy's top knot for awarrior's shaved pate. It was aprofound, often physically rigoroustransition. Picture, if you will, thesymbolic, yet intensely demandingcomponents. Hours spent in icy coldbaths for spiritual purification orenduring long periods of kneeling insilent contemplation, pushing the veryboundaries of physical discomfort andmental resolve. The dawning of new adultrobes, often presented by a godfather,symbolized not just a change inappearance, but a solemn vow to upholdthe Bushidto code, a lifealteringcommitment to a path of unwaveringdiscipline and potential death on thebattlefield. This was the precise momenta boy officially shed his childhood,stepping into the formidable boots of afullyfledged warrior.Once their minds were being molded,their bodies were subjected to an evenmore relentless forge. Imagine daysblurring into nights, not from revalry,but from deliberate, agonizing sleepdeprivation, perhaps through endlessmeditation or ritualistic chantingdesigned to push the very limits ofhuman consciousness.Then picture them confronting the raw,unyielding power of nature, meditatingstoically beneath frigid winterwaterfalls, their bodies shiveringuncontrollably or standing for hoursunder the merciless glare of the summersun, their skin baking. These weren'tmerely exercises. They were crucibles ofendurance, stripping away every comfortand exposing the raw essence of theirwill. Every ache, every shiver, everygnawing pang of hunger was a deliberatelesson in resilience. Transforming theirphysical weakness into an unyielding,unbreakable resolve, forging a body assharp and indomitable as their blade.Beyond mere physical endurance, samuraiinitiates were deliberately plunged intothe crucible of pain, not as punishment,but as a forge for their minds. Thiswasn't about gratuitous suffering, butabout controlled, self-inflicteddiscomfort, designed to cultivate anunbreakable mental fortitude. Pictureyoung warriors perhaps holdingincredibly strenuous stances for hourson end until muscles screamed, orenduring extremes of heat and cold withonly their willpower as a shield. Someaccounts suggest disciplined repetitivestrikes to areas of the body, not tocause injury, but to desensitize andaccustom them to the shocks of battle.The objective was clear. To master theirown physiological responses, to embracediscomfort, and to systematicallydismantle the natural human urge torecoil from pain, transforming it into atool for unwavering focus and anunyielding will.Beyond the grueling physical demands,samurai initiates faced psychologicaltrials designed to rip fear from theirvery souls. Imagine a young recruitalone spending a desolate night in asilent moonlit graveyard, surrounded bythe whispers of the departed. Thiswasn't merely a macabra tale.
